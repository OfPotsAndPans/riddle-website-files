        <strong>July 9, 2019:</strong> After 17, almost continuous, hours I uploaded my first <a href="https://www.foryoureyesonly.cf/" target="_blank">website</a> after deciding to learn how to create a website with HTML and CSS.</p>


    <p style=”color:#000;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;”>

        <strong>July 10, 2019:</strong> I decided to learn how to host my own website <em>whynotme.cf</em> from home and successfully hosted it for the world to see for a brief period of time. However, until I figure out how to properly secure my home
        network from potential security threats it shall only be accessable if a user is on my own private network. Click <a href=”/writing/poems.html” target=”_blank”>here</a> to visit a direct replica of that website.</p>

        <strong>July 12, 2019:</strong> I began to teach myself javascript so I may incorporate it into my websites and continued to improve upon my first <a href=”/Users/salambdeir/Desktop/index.html” target=”_blank”>website</a>. Trying to incorporate
        javascript into my second <a href=”/artwork/sketches.html” target=”_blank”>website</a> has been frustrating to figure out what possible issues are preventing my code from working.

        <strong>July 13, 2019:</strong> After deploying from a new repository with updated HTML and CSS files for my website, the deployment status started showing as failed with the presence of error:
        <em>failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 1</em> The link to my domain was unreachable and I had to resort to an old deployment of the website while I figured out how I lost the 'build' command in my package.
        This could have been a result of me messing around with github's different tabs. I created 'branches' but I don't understand how to use them yet. For the time being, my solution was to delete the repository and re-upload my files in a new repository.
        with solved the issue. to view my
        <a href=”/Users/salambdeir/Desktop/index.html” target=”_blank”>website</a> click here. Trying to incorporate javascript into my second
        <a href=”/artwork/sketches.html” target=”_blank”>website</a> has been frustrating to figure out what possible issues are preventing my code from working.

        <strong>July 16, 2019:</strong> My website has undergone some major changes. Now links redirect to other parts of this website; including this one before hand this page was not hosted on the website at all. A completely redesigned homepage and personality have been adapted. 
        I am continuing to familarize myself with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Eventually I hope to incorporate some Javascripts I am working on. In addition, I am also working on embedding a few Java programs I have made in the past directly onto my website. </p>
